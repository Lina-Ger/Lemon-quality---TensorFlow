# Lemon-quality---TensorFlow
Binary image classification with Tensorflow '2.9.1'

Lemon images of good and bad quality taken from a public Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufemir/lemon-quality-dataset) are used for fruit quality control. A basic yet complete pipeline for the classification analysis is formed (validation accuracy: 97.59%), including data pre-processing, data configuration, creation of the Convolution Neural Network etc.

The folder with the images can be found under the dataset folder; the Python script is named as lemon_qlt_analysis. Finally along with the aforemntioned you can access two images - 16 lemon samples from the training set and the training/testing performance.
